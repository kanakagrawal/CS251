REFLECTION ESSAY:
	Q A1. Same as inlab que.
	Q A2. There was some problem with defining variables as global. We've written two functions in the code and have taken input twice.
	Q A3. We couldn't find the coordinates of TIE after time t1. We thought to somehow break the circumference of circle in 100 pieces and make 	  a 2D array containing coordinates of 100 equidistant pts. on circle but couldn't implemented. Also tried doing via slope and other 		  methods.
	Q B1. Learnt that (summation(ai1*x1)) mod 2 = summation((ai1 mod 2)*xi). After this question was very easy. 
	Q B2. Used a dummy matrix(test(mxn)) to create A(mnxmn) matrix. After that same as Q B1.
