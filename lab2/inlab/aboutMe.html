			Hi, I am Kanak. I was born and brought up in a small district Gondia.
		</p>
		<p> 
			I studied in gondia from std.1<sup>st</sup> to std.10<sup>th</sup> in Vivek Mandir High School which provided me a good base in both acads and extra-curricular.</p>
		<p>
			Then, to prepare for JEE I came to IIT-HOME nagpur in std. 11<sup>th</sup>for 2 years. There I got great teachers and great friends who helped me in my route towards JEE Advanced 2015.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hardwork and commitment during preparations bring me here at CSE,IIT BOMBAY.
