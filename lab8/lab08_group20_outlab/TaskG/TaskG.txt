To optimize the code it was necessary to first identify the slow part of code. To do so, we change the makefile and added -pg flag to the compiling command.
Next we executed the ./a.out. It took a while to execute but after execution gmon.out file was created.
Then we used gprof to identify the slow part of code.
Run the following command:	gprof a.out > profile.txt
Now we check the profile.txt file and from the values of time taken in different function in flat profile we concluded that function Monster::computeArmLength() was very slow.
Now we checked the code of it in monster.cpp
In that to calculate term*size^3. It is done via 2 for loops. Also later term is multiplied by this and divided by size^2. Therefore we replace this code with just multiplying term by size just once.
This made the code very fast.
Now on running the executable we got the following output:
