Steps:
1) Downloaded Azkaban.zip
2) Start eclipse
3) Open Azkaban project in eclipse via following steps:
	a) go to file>import.
	b) Under the General tab select "Existing projects in Workspace"
	c) Select the archive file option and browse to the zip file.
4) We need to change the JRE system library. So go the the JRE system library in Project and explorer. Right click and select properties.
5) Change the system library to alternate JRE and select the latest java-openjdk.
6) Go to the code in Sort.java and correct some variable name errors.
Now the code is error free(syntax wise) and gives output sirius is criminal.
7) To debug we use toggle breakpoints and different lines in the code and then run the code in debug mode. To do this use the following steps:
	a) to toggle breakpoint at any line right click at its very legft point and select toggle breakpoint.
	b) After setting some breakpoints go to the file in project explorer right click and select debug as>java application.
	c) Now you will get a debug mode in which the value of variables at the break point can be seen
	Now use F5,F6,F7,F8 for commands such as step, next, continue, etc.(similar to gdb).
8) Once the debugging is done. Save and now export the project and then compress it.
